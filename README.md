# VaultDB Front End

This suite demos a parser for extracting a DAG of database operators from a SQL statement.   It regularizes the operator order to push down filters and projections.  In addition, it eagerly eliminates columns as they are no longer needed from the query's intermediate results.


## Dependencies

This system builds with (TODO):
* Java XX
* Maven YY
